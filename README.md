# IndSpecVeMo - an Individual-Specific Vector Model

This repository contains the code for the individual-specific vector model by Fischer, Ramazi, Simmons, Poesch and Lewis (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14284). 

The methods partially build on the libdatrie package (https://github.com/pytries/datrie) and hence the repository includes a snapshot of the project's code.

**Caution:** this is an as-is version of the code from the research project. That is, the code is not yet fully cleaned up and documented. 

To run the model, the settrie extension has to be compiled (see _setup_settriec.py). On Windows, the VisualStudio compiler needs to be installed and in the PATH environment variable for this purpose.

To install the package, make sure the python package manager "pip" is available. Open a console in the folder where setup.py is located and run
```
pip install .
```
