# IndSpecVeMo - an Individual-Specific Vector Model

This repository contains the code for the individual-specific vector model by Fischer, Ramazi, Simmons, Poesch and Lewis (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14284). 

The methods partially build on the libdatrie package (https://github.com/pytries/datrie) and hence the repository includes a snapshot of the project's code.

**Caution:** this is an as-is version of the code from the research project. That is, the code is not yet fully cleaned up and documented; proper packaging is yet to be done as well. 

To run the model, the settriec extension has to be compiled (see _setup_settriec.py).
